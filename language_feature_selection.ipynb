    "For this section, we used 2 different filter feature selection methods to try to understand the data better. The first method we use is the pearsonr correlation, which we used to compare word count, average word length, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. Then we used mutual information to compare all of the features we extracted. Mutual information was used because it is good at handling both low-dimensionality (eg Word Count) and high dimensionality (eg BERT embeddings) features and captures non-linear relationships between features and target variables."
