## Study 2: Designing explainable speech-based machine learning for the estimation of job interview outcomes

We have recieved three datasets i.e prosodic features, scores and transcripts. The codebase is divided into different smaller codes files to keep the individual contributions seperate and we can finally simplify the approaches on the final codebase.
